# TripAdvisor Project

##Problem
You are planning on visiting Atlanta and you are interested in getting the best bargain for the hotel they are staying in. When looking for particular hotels, you have certain preferences that you would like your hotel to have. You are also a frequent reviewer on TripAdvisor, so you have a basis of what you're looking for in a hotel. What would be the best way of deciding on the hotel to stay at? Also, what would the price be for similar hotels?
##Solution
This project is an end-to-end project that will scrape hotel information and reviews on each hotel using a pipeline to my Mongo Database. Then I will cluster reviews using TF-IDF and K-means. Then I will cluster the hotel based on amenities avaliable and other characteristics. After, I will include a demo using Jupyter Notebook.
##Tools
Python 3.6.7
MongoDB
Scrapy
Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine
